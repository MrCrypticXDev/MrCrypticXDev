Hi, thanks for stopping by, I code Discord Bots most of the time & fizzle around with it's raw API aswell as experimenting new stuff with bots. I don't open source a lot of my code as their for current public bots I use & teams I work with. You can shoot me a message on Discord if you happen to be in any "Mutual Servers" as I don't accept friend as much, but you can ask. ðŸ˜„
